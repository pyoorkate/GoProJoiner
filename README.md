# GoProJoiner
Really shonky and basic python script to sort GoPro files into the correct order and join them together

'I' built this using ChatGPT (for the sort algorithm), a *lot* of refinement to get the sort order correct, and then using a mixture of Google and my very rusty memory of coding to add some niceties (like telling you what stage it's at) and to get it to automatically fire up FFMPEG to join the files together.

Don't expect me to ever do anything else with it unless it breaks.
